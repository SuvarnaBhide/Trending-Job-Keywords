Job Title: Full Stack Engineer
Company: Ellty

About the job
Looking for a Full Stack developer who has experience in Frontend development using React/nextjs and backend with NestJS & MongoDB. 

 
Experience with the AWS would be a plus but not really required, as we are not looking for a jack of all trades. If you have experience with Three.js and Theatre.js, that's also a huge advantage. 



PLEASE READ THE REQUIREMENT CAREFULLY BELOW. 

The project requires heavy use of React/NextJS and NestJS/MongoDB. You should have worked on this or similar platform/frameworks. You should be available for long term engagement. 

 
Note: 
A) This requires the agreement on NDA, please do not respond if you have issues in signing the NDA.
B) Should have the availability of a minimum of 40 hrs/week with a minimum of 8 hours every day. (weekdays)
C) Should provide updates every day. (No exception) 

E) Your deadline culture is fine.
F) Long-term work over six months is okay for you.


Most importantly: 

1. You have a meticulous eye for detail and can painstakingly do Frontend development to get as close to Figma as possible.
2. We don't have super complicated backend tasks, but you need to think a couple of steps ahead when implementing the backend and eliminate possible gross errors in advance.
 
Conditions:

Work schedule: full-time (8h)
Remote work
Full availability during scheduled hours
